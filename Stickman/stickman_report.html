					<h2>Report of Stickman</h2>
				</div>
			
			<div class="h4"><i>1.Basic drawing</i></div>
			<p>The stickman consists of 11 cuboids with different sizes and colors. The position of each cubiod is fixed
                manually to make a man.</p>
				
			<div class="h4"><i>2.Translation and Rotation</i></div>
			<p>Three.js has its own 'translate' and 'rotate' functions. What I do are, firstly, using the matrix stack
                to do translation and rotation from leaf node to root node (the body structure can be recognized as
                a tree where forearms and calives are the leaf nodes and the head is the root node.) secondly,
                plusing every cubiod's x-position with one to do the body translation. </p>
				
			<div class="h4"><i>3.Animation</i></div>
			<p>Animation is implemented by periodically rendering six different frames with a 200ms interval. Three
                of six are related to left arm and right leg while the other three related to right arm and left leg.
                To make the walking style like a real man, both the 1st frame and the 4th frame don't have a translation
                on x-axis. If you have watched his walking, you can feel that change.</p>
				
			<div class="h4"><i>4.Operation</i></div>
			<p>On that html page, I offered the view-change control and the 'start/stop/pause/next_state' control.
				View-change is implemented by changing the position of camera and its 'lookAt' direction. State-control
                is implemented by a boolean variable sent to the rendering function.
                Example: you can see the top view by click the top-view button which won't have an effect on his
                walking state, you can also click 'stop' button to see at this time what his posture is. 'next_state'
                button helps you see all the frames while he is standing still.</p>
				
			<div class="h4"><i>5.Realtime Display</i></div>
			<p>Realtime dispaly shows 3 different views. It actually uses the same scene and even the same render while
                the main idea is changing the rendering area. That is to say, the render rendering the same scene at
                three diferent areas on your screen at almost the same time.</p>
				
			<div class="h4"><i>6.Issues</i></div>
			<p>I think the main problem is not familiar with three.js's API.And I learn most from the examples on the
                Internet.</p>
				
			<div class="h4"><i>7.Conclusion</i></div>
			<p>This assignment let us step in the world of computer graphics and also get some new impression on it. I think it's
			a good start for me and others.</p>
