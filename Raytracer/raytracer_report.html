					<p>1).The ray direction emitted from your eyes should be set properly, otherwise the final image seem to be distorted. <code>(x/width, y/width, 1)</code>
					<br> 2).When calculating the closest intersection point, we should pick the
						minimum one between two possible results.<br>
						<img src="file_rt/equation.PNG" alt=""><br>3).Don't forget to consider the shadow part, there are two ways:<br>
						<img src="file_rt/shadow.PNG" alt=""><br> 4).Before calculating vector H in Blinn_Phong Model, L and V should
						be normalized first.<br>
						<br><br>

					<div class="h3"><i>4.Experimental Results</i></div>
						<p><i><strong>1).Phong vs Blinn_Phong:</strong> </i>the highlights of Blinn_Phong looks larger than those of Phong,
						&nbsp; &nbsp; however, the main difference is reflected in the overall effect - Blinn_Phong appears to be more <i>natural</i>.
						Due to the color I set, it's not very obvious like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn%E2%80%93Phong_shading_model">wiki's</a></p>
						<p><i><strong>2).Recurision depth:</strong> </i>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;as the images dipicted, the reflection of the red sphere on the blue
						sphere appears only when depth greater than 1.</p>
						<p><i><strong>3).ka, kd, ks, n_shiny, rc:</strong> </i>
						<ul>
							<li>ka, ks and kd correspond to the intensity of ambient light, of specular light and of diffuse light respectively.</li>
							<li>n_shiny and the size of highlghts are inversely proportional. </li>
							<li>rc is a balance between the light intensity of reflected area and of the other area.</li>
						</ul></p>
						<p><i><strong>4).More lights:</strong> </i> More lights bring more highlghts and of course shiner spheres.</p>
						<br>
					<div class="h3"><i>5.Conclusion</i></div>
					<p>This experiment is somewhat harder than the previous one. However the harder part is neither the light model nor the ray
						tracing algorithm, it's the detail, because there are many details you'll never even notice while it's easy for us to figure 
						out how the light model or the algorithm works. Some details has been mentioned at 'Implementation Details' and still there are many
						of them not mentioned. Just like the words my teacher (@Baoquan Chen) said at last class, 'Evils are
						in the Details', though not the same thing.
